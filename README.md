# The Derg Programming Language Project
Derg is a programming language built to transpile into readable and native-capable Luau at **zero-cost**.

## Why use Derg?
- **Performance:** Derg is intended to be a zero-cost programming language, meaning that the Luau code it transpiles to will be just as fast or even faster than hand-written Luau code.
- **Readability:** Built for extensive projects, Derg expands on Luau's type system by implementing compile-time type creation, allowing for features such as `Partial<T>` to exist at no extra cost.
- **Conciseness:** Derg is stuffed full of features to make code shorter and more specialized, all of which compile down to simple to read Luau code with minimal abstraction. Such features include `trait`'s, `static` functions, and well as some features invented for Derg such as `partial` functions and multi-name types.

Examples of the current Derg semantic can be found in the examples folder.
